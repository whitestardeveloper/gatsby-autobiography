   "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure
    and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system,
    and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder

    because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.
